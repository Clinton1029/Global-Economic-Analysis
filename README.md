# Global Economic Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes global economic indicators, such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and personal remittances, to identify trends and correlations across different regions and countries. The project follows a structured workflow for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing and handling missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summarizing datasets and visualizing distributions.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Correlation and trend identification.
- **Data Visualization:** Graphs and plots for better insights.
- **Automated Workflow:** A streamlined execution through `main.py`.
- **Regional Comparisons:** Analyzing economic performance across different regions.
- **Trend Analysis:** Identifying economic trends over time.
- **GDP vs. Unemployment Correlation:** Understanding economic stability indicators.
- **Box Plot Analysis:** Comparing GDP growth distributions.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive analysis
- **Logging** for tracking the workflow
- **Git** for version control
